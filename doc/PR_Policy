Pull Request Policy:
====================

The Tutora project as a whole (meaning all its code repos) has
one BDUG (Benevolent Dictator Until Graduation) and each subproject
within Tutora has at most 2 Advocates.

For every repository, only the BDUG and the repo's Advocates have
write permissions, which also means that they are responsible for
anything that goes wrong.

So the main developer workflow is the following:
1] If the change that you want to apply, or the
   bug that you want to fix, is not listed in the
   issues of the repo, please submit an issue
   first.
2] Fork the specific repository
3] Apply your changes
4] Submit a pull request
5] If your code does not come with tests please
   explain why and describe how you tested your
   changes.
6] Await for other developers and at least one
   Advocate to review the code and give you feedback.
7] If there is something wrong then go back to 1],
   else you are ready to submit your code change.
8] Email the BDUG or the appropriate Advocate for
   the code you changed and attach your patch on
   the email. On the email you should also mention
   the developers and the Advocate that approved
   your code review. They will push your patch to
   master (using your username and email as a
   commiter).
